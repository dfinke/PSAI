# PSAI Skills Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Anthropic Claude Skills pattern in PSAI, enabling PowerShell-based AI agents to use modular, filesystem-based capabilities with progressive disclosure.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Functions

1. **Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter** (`Public/Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter.ps1`)
   - Scans a directory for SKILL.md files
   - Extracts YAML frontmatter (name and description)
   - Returns skill metadata as JSON or PowerShell objects
   - Implements Level 1 loading (metadata discovery)

2. **Read-PSAISkill** (`Public/Read-PSAISkill.ps1`)
   - Reads the complete content of a skill file
   - Returns file content as raw string
   - Implements Level 2 loading (on-demand instructions)

### Module Integration

- Added functions to `PSAI.psm1` module loader
- Exported functions in `PSAI.psd1` manifest
- Functions follow existing PSAI naming conventions and patterns
- Integrated seamlessly with existing New-Agent and Get-AgentResponse functions

### Testing

Created comprehensive test suites:
- `__tests__/Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter.tests.ps1` (6 tests)
- `__tests__/Read-PSAISkill.tests.ps1` (5 tests)
- All tests pass (197 total tests in the suite)

### Sample Skills

Created three example skills in `skills/public/`:

1. **read-file** - File reading operations
2. **write-file** - File writing operations  
3. **process-management** - Process information and management

Each skill demonstrates:
- Proper YAML frontmatter structure
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Code examples with PowerShell syntax
- Best practices sections

### Documentation

1. **skills/README.md**
   - Comprehensive guide to PSAI Skills
   - Architecture explanation (3-level loading)
   - Usage examples with code
   - Skill creation guidelines
   - Best practices

2. **README.md** (main)
   - Added PSAI Skills section
   - Quick start examples
   - Integration with agents
   - References to Anthropic documentation

3. **examples/Use-PSAISkills.ps1**
   - Complete working example
   - Shows agent creation with skills
   - Interactive and prompt-based usage
   - Properly documented with help text

## Anthropic Claude Skills Pattern

The implementation follows the three-level loading architecture:

### Level 1: Metadata (Always Loaded)
- YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md files
- Contains `name` and `description` fields
- Loaded at agent initialization
- Enables skill discovery without full content

### Level 2: Instructions (Loaded On-Demand)
- Main body of SKILL.md files
- Contains workflows, examples, and guidance
- Loaded when agent determines skill is relevant
- Uses Read-PSAISkill function

### Level 3: Resources (Loaded As Needed)
- Additional markdown files
- Scripts and utilities
- Reference materials
- Future enhancement opportunity

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Function Naming**: Used `PSAI` prefix to distinguish from spike implementation
2. **Parameter Consistency**: Matched existing PSAI parameter patterns
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing directories and files
4. **Flexibility**: Support for both JSON and PSCustomObject output
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline help following PowerShell standards

## How It Works

### Discovery Phase
```powershell
$skillsMetadata = Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter -SkillsRoot "./skills"
```
Agent receives compact metadata about all available skills.

### Loading Phase
```powershell
Read-PSAISkill -Fullname $skill.fullname
```
Agent loads full instructions only when needed.

### Agent Integration
```powershell
$instructions = @"
You have access to these skills:
$(Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter -SkillsRoot "./skills" -Compress)
"@

$agent = New-Agent -Tools @('Read-PSAISkill') -Instructions $instructions
```

## Benefits

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Only loads content as needed
2. **Modular Design**: Easy to add/remove skills
3. **Reusability**: Skills can be shared across agents
4. **Discoverability**: Metadata makes skills easily findable
5. **Maintainability**: Each skill is self-contained
6. **Extensibility**: Clear pattern for creating new skills

## Usage Example

```powershell
# Import the module
Import-Module PSAI

# Create a skills-enabled agent
$instructions = @"
You are a PowerShell Skills AI Assistant.
Use Read-PSAISkill to access skill content when needed.
Available skills: $(Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter -SkillsRoot "./skills" -Compress)
"@

$agent = New-Agent `
    -Tools @('Invoke-Expression', 'Read-PSAISkill') `
    -Instructions $instructions `
    -Name 'PSSkillsAgent'

# Ask the agent a question
$agent | Get-AgentResponse "How do I read a file in PowerShell?"
```

## Comparison with Spike Implementation

The spike implementation in `spikes/PowerShell-Skills/PSSkills.ps1` was used as reference but this implementation differs in:

1. **Function Names**: `Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter` vs `Get-SkillFrontmatter`
2. **Integration**: Fully integrated into PSAI module vs standalone script
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage added
4. **Documentation**: Full inline help and documentation
5. **Examples**: Structured examples with proper commenting

## Files Changed/Added

### New Files
- `Public/Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter.ps1`
- `Public/Read-PSAISkill.ps1`
- `__tests__/Get-PSAISkillFrontmatter.tests.ps1`
- `__tests__/Read-PSAISkill.tests.ps1`
- `examples/Use-PSAISkills.ps1`
- `skills/README.md`
- `skills/public/read-file/SKILL.md`
- `skills/public/write-file/SKILL.md`
- `skills/public/process-management/SKILL.md`

### Modified Files
- `PSAI.psm1` - Added function imports
- `PSAI.psd1` - Added function exports
- `README.md` - Added Skills section

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- Total Tests: 197
- Passed: 197
- Failed: 0
- New Tests Added: 11

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Level 3 Resources**: Support for bundled scripts and resources
2. **Skill Registry**: Central catalog of available skills
3. **Skill Templates**: Scaffolding for creating new skills
4. **Skill Validation**: Automated checking of skill structure
5. **Remote Skills**: Loading skills from remote repositories
6. **Skill Dependencies**: Skills that reference other skills
7. **Skill Categories**: Organizing skills by domain

## Security Considerations

- Read-PSAISkill should only be used to read skill files
- Agent instructions enforce this constraint
- No external dependencies added
- No network access required
- All code is local and auditable

## Conclusion

The PSAI Skills implementation successfully ports the Anthropic Claude Skills architecture pattern to PowerShell, providing a robust, tested, and well-documented framework for creating modular AI agent capabilities. The implementation maintains consistency with existing PSAI patterns while introducing powerful new functionality for building specialized agents.
