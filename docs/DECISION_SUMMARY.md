## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Plan A: Core Integration | Plan B: Separate Modules | Plan C: Hybrid |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Timeline** | 6 weeks | 8 weeks | 8 weeks |
| **User Install** | `Install-Module PSAI` | `Install-Module PSAI, PSAISkills, PSAIToolbox` | `Install-Module PSAI, PSAI.Skills.*, PSAI.Toolbox.*` |
| **Maintenance** | Single codebase | Multiple codebases | Complex architecture |
| **Flexibility** | Limited | High | Very High |
| **Risk** | Higher (breaking changes) | Lower (isolated) | Medium |

## Three Implementation Options

### Plan A: Integrate into PSAI Core

**What**: Add Skills and Toolbox as built-in features of PSAI module

**Usage Example**:
```powershell
$agent = New-Agent `
    -Skills @('code-review', 'security-audit') `
    -AutoLoadToolbox `
    -Name "CodeReviewer"
```

**Choose if you want**:
- ‚úÖ Best user experience (single module)
- ‚úÖ Tight integration between Skills and Toolbox
- ‚úÖ Complete PowerShell AI solution in one package
- ‚ùå Don't mind larger module size
- ‚ùå Confident in core feature adoption

---

### Plan B: Separate Companion Modules

**What**: Create PSAISkills and PSAIToolbox as independent modules

**Usage Example**:
```powershell
Import-Module PSAI, PSAISkills, PSAIToolbox

$agent = New-AgentWithSkills `
    -Skills @('code-review') `
    | New-AgentWithToolbox -AutoLoadFromEnv
```

**Choose if you want**:
- ‚úÖ Modular installation (users choose what they need)
- ‚úÖ Independent versioning and releases
- ‚úÖ Lower risk experimentation
- ‚úÖ Easy community contribution
- ‚ùå Don't mind managing multiple modules
- ‚ùå Want flexibility to iterate quickly

---

### Plan C: Hybrid (Provider Pattern)

**What**: Core infrastructure in PSAI, content in provider modules

**Usage Example**:
```powershell
$agent = New-Agent `
    -SkillProviders @('Anthropic') `
    -ToolboxProviders @('Sourcegraph')
```

**Choose if you want**:
- ‚úÖ Extensible architecture for future providers
- ‚úÖ Support multiple skill/toolbox formats
- ‚úÖ Community-built providers
- ‚ùå Don't mind complex initial implementation
- ‚ùå Planning long-term plugin ecosystem

## Our Recommendation

### ü•á Primary: Plan A (Core Integration)

**Why**: 
- PoC proves Skills and Toolbox work seamlessly with PSAI
- Single module provides best user experience
- Skills and Toolboxes are complementary (work better together)
- PSAI is already comprehensive; these fit naturally

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Make features opt-in (no breaking changes)
- Use semantic versioning
- Lightweight implementation (mostly parsing)

### ü•à Alternative: Plan B (Separate Modules)

**Why**:
- Lower risk if adoption uncertain
- Faster iteration without PSAI changes
- Easier community contributions
- Can migrate to Plan A later if successful

---

## How to Decide

**Choose Plan A if**:
- You want to position PSAI as the complete PowerShell AI solution
- User experience is top priority
- You're confident in Skills/Toolbox value
- You prefer simpler installation/management

**Choose Plan B if**:
- You want to experiment with lower risk
- You anticipate rapid iteration
- You want community ownership
- You prefer modular architecture

**Choose Plan C if**:
- You're planning for multiple skill/toolbox formats
- You want a long-term extensible ecosystem
- You have resources for complex architecture
- Enterprise scenarios require custom providers
