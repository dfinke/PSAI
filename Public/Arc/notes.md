Skills Support:

- The repository has extensive support for skills (also compatible with Claude Code and Codex CLI formats)
- Skills are loaded from ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md (Claude Code format) and ~/.codex/skills/ (Codex CLI format)
- There's a dedicated skills module in packages/coding-agent that handles loading and formatting skills
